to identify vacant rooms.\nThey spend a lot of time house hunting with sometimes, first times being conned by people mascarading to be house owners to pay in advance even before they see the room they want to occupy. \nThis system tries to solve the problems students face as they go about looking for affordable houses. \nIt will proivde them with direct link to the house owners who will provide explicit details of the room including costs and number of occupants. \nTherefore, from a single platform, students are able to get variety of options without wasting much time and

hostels. \nStudents who fail to secure university rooms find it hard to identify vacant rooms.\nThey spend a lot of time house hunting with sometimes, first times being conned by people mascarading to be house owners to pay in advance even before they see the room they want to occupy. \nThis system tries to solve the problems students face as they go about looking for affordable houses. \nIt will proivde them with direct link to the house owners who will provide explicit details of the room including costs and number of occupants. \nTherefore, from a single platform, students are able to get variety of options without wasting much time and effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n
